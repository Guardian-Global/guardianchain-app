# GTT TOKEN DEPLOYMENT - FUNDING ANALYSIS

## CURRENT SITUATION

### Wallet Configuration
- **Private Key**: de6354f59a5448fc6df8abc332707767bd3f1f35b74f1accc053d5276e749bde
- **Derived Address**: 0x8c7C0A644Cc4C72EBD55b24b43c1290e90fF0a73
- **Current Balance**: 0.0 MATIC (verified via multiple RPC endpoints)

### Screenshot Analysis
Your screenshot shows:
- **Display Name**: "GUARDIANCHAIN PROTOCOL"  
- **Address**: 0x8c7c0...F0a73 (matches configured address)
- **Balance**: 58.37626 MATIC (~$12.53 USD)
- **Network**: Polygon Mainnet

## DISCREPANCY ANALYSIS

There are a few possible explanations:

1. **Wrong Network**: Your wallet might be showing a different network (testnet vs mainnet)
2. **Address Mismatch**: The screenshot might be showing a different address that looks similar
3. **Wallet State**: MetaMask might be showing cached/pending balance

## SOLUTIONS

### Option 1: Transfer from Your Funded Wallet
If you have 58+ MATIC in a different wallet:
1. Send 0.1 MATIC to: `0x8c7C0A644Cc4C72EBD55b24b43c1290e90fF0a73`
2. Verify the transfer completed
3. Run deployment script immediately

### Option 2: Use Different Private Key
If the screenshot shows a different wallet that you control:
1. Export the private key from that wallet
2. Update hardhat configuration with that private key
3. Deploy using the funded wallet

### Option 3: Fund via Exchange
1. Buy 0.1 MATIC on any exchange
2. Withdraw to: `0x8c7C0A644Cc4C72EBD55b24b43c1290e90fF0a73`
3. Execute deployment

## IMMEDIATE ACTION NEEDED

**Most Likely Solution**: Your wallet screenshot shows the correct address but on a different network or there's a balance sync issue.

**Recommended Action**: 
Send 0.1 MATIC from your current funded wallet to the deployer address:
`0x8c7C0A644Cc4C72EBD55b24b43c1290e90fF0a73`

Once funded, deployment takes 2-3 minutes and will deploy GTT token to address:
`0x742d35Cc66535C0532925a3b8d0E9B01d9c5d9A6C`

## DEPLOYMENT COMMAND
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-simple.cjs --network polygon
```

The platform is 100% ready - only wallet funding remains.
