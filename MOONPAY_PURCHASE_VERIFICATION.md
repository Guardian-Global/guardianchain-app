## NEXT STEPS (SUPER SIMPLE)

### Step 1: Wait for Delivery (5-10 minutes)

Your POL tokens are being sent to wallet: 0x26A61461802E74A265c7548Efb8CaDDf4c4a81Dc

### Step 2: Find Your Wallet

Since you used MoonPay, the tokens will appear in one of these:

- **MoonPay wallet** (check the MoonPay app)
- **MetaMask** (if you connected it during purchase)
- **The wallet address shown**: 0x26A61461802E74A265c7548Efb8CaDDf4c4a81Dc

### Step 3: Transfer to Deployment Wallet

Once the POL arrives, you'll send 0.1 POL to our deployment address:
**Send to**: 0xD500A7fED4ef78c6d99888c8FeBDbA4BcB12ed38

### Step 4: Automatic Deployment

I have a script running that will automatically deploy the GTT token within 2-3 minutes after receiving the POL.
