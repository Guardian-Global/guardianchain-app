# .env and Vercel Environment Variables

Your project uses Vercel for deployment. Vercel injects environment variables (secrets) at build and runtime, so you do not need to commit them to your repository.

## How Vercel Handles Secrets
- Secrets set in the Vercel dashboard are available as environment variables in your deployed app.
- For Node.js/Express/backend: use `process.env.YOUR_KEY`.
- For Vite/React frontend: use `import.meta.env.VITE_YOUR_KEY` (must be prefixed with `VITE_`).

## Local Development
- To use secrets locally, create a `.env.local` file in your project root (and/or in `/client` for frontend-only vars).
- Copy the variable names from Vercel and paste them here with their values.
- **Never commit real secrets to your repo.**

## Exporting Vercel Secrets
To export all your Vercel project secrets for backup or local use:

```sh
vercel env pull .env.local
```

This will create a `.env.local` file with all your current Vercel environment variables.

## Example .env.local
```
VITE_API_URL=https://api.example.com
API_SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
ANOTHER_KEY=your-other-secret
```

## Best Practices
- Keep your secrets in Vercel and out of your repo.
- Use `.env.local` for local dev, and add it to `.gitignore`.
- Regularly back up your secrets from Vercel.
