# GuardianChain: Truth Vault Capsule dApp

## Overview
GuardianChain is a sovereign Web3 infrastructure for time-locked proof, grief-score yield, and capsule monetization. It enables users to mint Veritas Capsules, earn $GTT yield based on GriefScore™, and submit legacy, trauma, or testimony. The platform allows for replay, verification, and unlocking of time-sealed capsules via an integrated Veritas Certificate Engine. The project aims to establish institutional-grade memory infrastructure for sealing truth and unlocking value through blockchain technology and AI-powered verification, with a strategic focus on expanding into the Base Network for ultra-low fee transactions.
