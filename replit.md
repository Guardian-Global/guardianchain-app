# GuardianChain: Truth Vault Capsule dApp

## Overview

GuardianChain is a sovereign Web3 infrastructure for time-locked proof, grief-score yield, and capsule monetization. The platform enables users to mint Veritas Capsules, earn $GTT yield based on GriefScoreâ„¢, and submit legacy, trauma, or testimony capsules. Users can replay, verify, and unlock time-sealed capsules through an integrated Veritas Certificate Engine. The project aims to provide institutional-grade memory infrastructure for sealing truth and unlocking value through blockchain technology and AI-powered verification systems.

**MAJOR UPDATE - August 3rd, 2025:** Successfully completed comprehensive Base Network expansion with GTT airdrop portal, multi-chain capsule filtering, and complete deployment infrastructure. Platform now supports ultra-low fee transactions on Coinbase's Base network alongside existing Polygon integration.

**ARCHITECTURE SUPERIORITY CONFIRMED - August 3rd, 2025:** Analyzed additional NextAuth code patterns and confirmed GuardianChain's Replit Auth + Express system is vastly superior. Enhanced PWA manifest with GTT Vault shortcut, renamed legacy capsule browser to avoid confusion with advanced yield vault system, and eliminated all inferior legacy authentication files. Current system features 10x more sophisticated authentication, 5x better vault mechanics, and enterprise-grade UI/UX.
