# GuardianChain: Truth Vault Capsule dApp

## Overview
GuardianChain is a sovereign Web3 infrastructure for time-locked proof, grief-score yield, and capsule monetization. The platform enables users to mint Veritas Capsules, earn $GTT yield based on GriefScore‚Ñ¢, and submit legacy, trauma, or testimony capsules. Users can replay, verify, and unlock time-sealed capsules through an integrated Veritas Certificate Engine. The project aims to provide institutional-grade memory infrastructure for sealing truth and unlocking value through blockchain technology and AI-powered verification systems.
