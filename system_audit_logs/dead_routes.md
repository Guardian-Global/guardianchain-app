# Dead Routes Audit Report
Generated: 2025-08-06

## Analysis: Pages vs Active Routes

### Pages Analyzed: 271 total .tsx files in /pages/
### Routes Active in App.tsx: ~50 lazy-loaded routes

## Test Pages Archived (Not in Routing)
- `asset-test.tsx` → ARCHIVED (was never wired to navigation)
- `simple-test.tsx` → ARCHIVED (was never wired to navigation) 
- `minting-test.tsx` → ARCHIVED (was never wired to navigation)

## Active Routes Verified
✅ All critical routes confirmed working:
- Homepage routing (EliteHomepage, CyberHomepage)
- Authentication flow (Login, Signup, CompleteAuthPage)
- Core features (CreateCapsule, Profile, Analytics)
- DAO governance (DAO, Vote, Staking, Audit)
- Enterprise features (Metrics, ValidatorPage, AdminDashboard)

## Unused Page Components
Many specialized page components exist but are loaded dynamically:
- Capsule-specific pages (podcaster.tsx, artist.tsx, scientist.tsx)
- Legal pages (privacy.tsx, terms.tsx, security.tsx)
- Specialized flows (governance.tsx, mint-nft.tsx)

**Note**: These are intentionally unused in current flow but may be activated later for specific user journeys.

## Navigation Integrity Check
✅ EliteLayout navigation intact
✅ App.tsx routing structure preserved
✅ Authentication-gated routes working
✅ No broken route imports detected

## Recommendations
- Consider dynamic route activation for specialized pages
- Maintain current lazy loading architecture
- Archive only confirmed orphaned test files
