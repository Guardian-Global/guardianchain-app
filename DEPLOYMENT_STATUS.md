## 🚀 Ready to Deploy

### Prerequisites Met:
- ✅ All contracts compile successfully
- ✅ Deployment scripts tested and ready
- ✅ Frontend integration complete
- ✅ API endpoints functional
- ✅ Environment configuration documented

### Next Steps:
1. Fund deployer wallet with native tokens (MATIC/ETH)
2. Add private key to environment variables
3. Run deployment commands:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-complete-mainnet.js --network polygon
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-complete-mainnet.js --network base
   ```
4. Update frontend environment variables with deployed addresses
5. Verify contracts on block explorers

### Estimated Costs:
- **Polygon:** ~0.05 MATIC ($0.04)
- **Base:** ~0.005 ETH ($16.50)
