# PRACTICAL GTT DEPLOYMENT SOLUTION

## THE REALITY CHECK
- Bridge gas fees: $35 (too expensive)
- MetaMask minimum: $100 (excessive) 
- Actual need: $0.02 for deployment

## OPTIMAL SOLUTION: EXCHANGE ROUTE

### Best Option: Coinbase/Binance Direct Withdrawal
**Total Cost**: $2-5 (withdrawal fee only)
**Time**: 15-30 minutes
**Steps**:
1. Send your ETH-MATIC to Coinbase/Binance
2. Convert to MATIC (if needed)
3. Withdraw directly to Polygon network
4. Use address: 0x959C1E8Baa6EB72A0A9F2547B59176a96dD239db

### Alternative: Buy Small Amount Direct
**Cheapest platforms**:
- **Ramp.network**: $5 minimum, 2.9% fee
- **MoonPay**: $3.99 fee for small amounts
- **Transak**: $5 minimum

**Direct buy in MetaMask**:
1. Switch to Polygon network
2. Buy $6-10 worth directly
3. Skip bridging entirely

## IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN

Since bridging is expensive, I recommend:

1. **Send 0.5 MATIC from Coinbase/Binance** (if you have account)
   - Cost: ~$2 withdrawal fee
   - Time: 20 minutes

2. **Or buy $10 direct on Polygon**
   - Use Ramp/MoonPay in MetaMask
   - Cost: ~$5-7 total

Either way, once you have MATIC on Polygon network, deployment takes 2-3 minutes.
