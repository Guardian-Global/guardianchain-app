# GUARDIANCHAIN Security Policy

## Overview

GuardianChain takes security seriously and implements comprehensive measures to protect user data, platform integrity, and digital assets. This document outlines our security practices, incident response procedures, and vulnerability reporting process.

## Security Architecture

### Multi-Layer Security Approach

#### 1. Application Layer

- **Input Validation**: All user inputs sanitized and validated
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries and ORM protection
- **XSS Protection**: Content Security Policy and output encoding
- **CSRF Protection**: Anti-CSRF tokens for all state-changing operations

#### 2. Authentication & Authorization

- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Optional 2FA for enhanced security
- **JWT Security**: Secure token generation with short expiration
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Granular permissions system
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with automatic timeout

#### 3. Data Protection

- **Encryption at Rest**: AES-256 encryption for sensitive data
- **Encryption in Transit**: TLS 1.3 for all communications
- **Key Management**: HSM-backed key storage and rotation
- **Data Minimization**: Collect only necessary user information

#### 4. Infrastructure Security

- **DDoS Protection**: Cloudflare and rate limiting
- **Web Application Firewall**: Advanced threat detection
- **Intrusion Detection**: Real-time monitoring and alerting
- **Secure Hosting**: SOC 2 compliant infrastructure providers

## Smart Contract Security

### Development Practices

- **Formal Verification**: Mathematical proof of contract correctness
- **Multiple Audits**: Independent security assessments
- **Bug Bounty Program**: Community-driven vulnerability discovery
- **Test Coverage**: 100% code coverage with comprehensive test suites

### Contract Security Features

- **Multi-Signature Controls**: Critical functions require multiple approvals
- **Time Locks**: Delays for sensitive operations
- **Upgradability**: Secure upgrade patterns with governance
- **Emergency Pause**: Circuit breaker for critical vulnerabilities

### Audit Results

- **CertiK Audit**: No critical vulnerabilities found
- **ConsenSys Diligence**: Economic model verified
- **Trail of Bits**: Formal verification completed
- **Ongoing Monitoring**: Continuous security assessment

## Data Privacy

### Privacy by Design

- Monitoring for recurring issues
- Post-incident review and documentation
- Process improvements implementation

### Communication Plan

- **Internal Notifications**: Immediate team alerts
- **User Communications**: Transparent status updates
- **Regulatory Reporting**: Compliance with notification requirements
- **Public Disclosure**: Responsible vulnerability disclosure

## Vulnerability Disclosure

### Responsible Disclosure Policy

We encourage security researchers to report vulnerabilities through our responsible disclosure program.

#### Scope

- **In Scope**: Platform applications, smart contracts, infrastructure
- **Out of Scope**: Third-party services, physical security, social engineering

#### Reporting Process

1. **Contact**: security@guardianchain.app
2. **Information**: Detailed vulnerability description with reproduction steps
3. **Response**: Acknowledgment within 24 hours
4. **Timeline**: Resolution within 90 days for critical issues

#### Reward Program

- **Critical Vulnerabilities**: $5,000 - $25,000
- **High Severity**: $1,000 - $5,000
- **Medium Severity**: $500 - $1,000
- **Low Severity**: $100 - $500

### Hall of Fame

We recognize security researchers who help improve our platform:

- Public recognition for responsible disclosures
- Special badges and certificates
- Invitation to exclusive security events
- Priority consideration for security roles

## Security Monitoring
