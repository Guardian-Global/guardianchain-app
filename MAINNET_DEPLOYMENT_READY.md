# ðŸš€ GUARDIANCHAIN MAINNET DEPLOYMENT - FINAL CONFIGURATION

## CURRENT STATUS: Alchemy RPC Connected âœ…

### âœ… WHAT'S WORKING:
- **Alchemy RPC:** Connected to Polygon mainnet successfully
- **Smart Contracts:** All compiled and ready for deployment  
- **Network Connection:** Verified connection to Chain ID 137 (Polygon)

### ðŸ”§ ISSUE IDENTIFIED:
The deployment is trying to use wallet **0x959C1E8Baa6EB72A0A9F2547B59176a96dD239db** but your MATIC funds are in wallet **0x7D1AfA7B718fb893dB30A3aBc0Cfc608AaCfeBB0**.

### ðŸŽ¯ SOLUTION NEEDED:
I need the **private key for wallet 0x7D1AfA7B718fb893dB30A3aBc0Cfc608AaCfeBB0** (the one with your $30 in MATIC) to complete the deployment.

### âš¡ DEPLOYMENT WILL COMPLETE IN 3 MINUTES ONCE CONFIGURED:
1. **Minute 1:** Deploy GTT Token contract
2. **Minute 2:** Deploy Truth Vault contract  
3. **Minute 3:** Deploy Guardian Pass contract
4. **Result:** GUARDIANCHAIN LIVE on Polygon mainnet!

**Please provide the private key for your funded wallet (0x7D1A...) so I can complete the deployment immediately.**
