**Cost**: ~$5-15 in ETH gas fees

**Steps**:
1. Go to https://portal.polygon.technology/bridge
2. Connect your MetaMask wallet
3. Select "From Ethereum" ‚Üí "To Polygon"
4. Choose MATIC token
5. Enter amount: 0.5 MATIC (enough for deployment + extras)
6. Confirm transaction in MetaMask
7. Wait 7-8 minutes for bridging

### Option 2: Exchange Transfer
**Exchanges**: Binance, Coinbase, KuCoin

### Option 3: Buy Direct MATIC on Polygon
**Services**: Ramp, MoonPay, Transak
**Time**: 5-10 minutes
**Cost**: 2-5% fee

**Steps**:
1. Use on-ramp service in MetaMask
2. Buy $5-10 worth of MATIC directly on Polygon
3. Skip bridging entirely

## RECOMMENDED APPROACH

**Use Official Polygon Bridge** - it's the most secure and straightforward:
1. Go to https://portal.polygon.technology/bridge
2. Bridge 0.5 MATIC from Ethereum to Polygon
3. Once completed (7-8 minutes), we deploy GTT immediately

## AFTER BRIDGING

Once you have MATIC on Polygon network:
1. Confirm balance appears in MetaMask on Polygon network
2. I'll deploy GTT token to 0x742d35Cc66535C0532925a3b8d0E9B01d9c5d9A6C
3. Deployment takes 2-3 minutes
4. GUARDIANCHAIN goes live on mainnet
