## 2. SUPPLY ECONOMICS

### 2.1 Total Supply Framework

#### Fixed Supply Model

**Design Philosophy**: GTT employs a fixed supply model to create scarcity value while ensuring sufficient tokens for long-term platform growth and user adoption.

```
Total Supply: 2,500,000,000 GTT (Fixed, No Additional Minting)

Supply Allocation Breakdown:
├── Circulating Supply (75%): 1,875,000,000 GTT
├── Staking Reserves (15%): 375,000,000 GTT
├── Development Fund (5%): 125,000,000 GTT
└── Emergency Reserve (5%): 125,000,000 GTT
```

#### Circulation Timeline

**Year 1**: 200,000,000 GTT (20% of total supply)
**Year 2**: 400,000,000 GTT (40% of total supply)
**Year 3**: 600,000,000 GTT (60% of total supply)
**Year 4**: 800,000,000 GTT (80% of total supply)
**Year 5**: 1,000,000,000 GTT (100% of total supply)

### 2.2 Emission Schedule

#### Controlled Release Mechanism

**Daily Emission Rate**: Variable based on platform activity

- **Base Rate**: 274,000 GTT/day (0.027% of total supply)
- **Activity Multiplier**: 0.5x to 2.0x based on verification volume
- **Performance Bonus**: Additional 10% for high-quality verifications
- **Seasonal Adjustments**: Holiday and event-based modifications

#### Emission Categories

```
Daily GTT Distribution (274,000 GTT):
├── Verification Rewards (40%): 109,600 GTT
├── Content Creation (25%): 68,500 GTT
├── Staking Rewards (20%): 54,800 GTT
├── Community Incentives (10%): 27,400 GTT
└── Platform Development (5%): 13,700 GTT
```

### 2.3 Deflationary Mechanisms

#### Token Burn Schedule

**Automatic Burns**:

- **Transaction Fees**: 2% of all platform fees burned monthly
- **Penalty Burns**: Violations result in token destruction
- **Buyback Burns**: 10% of quarterly profits used for burns
- **Milestone Burns**: Community achievement celebrations

**Burn Rate Projections**:

- **Year 1**: 20,000,000 GTT burned (2% of total supply)
- **Year 2**: 30,000,000 GTT burned (3% of total supply)
- **Year 3**: 40,000,000 GTT burned (4% of total supply)
- **Year 5**: 250,000,000 GTT total burned (10% reduction)

#### Economic Impact

**Net Supply Reduction**: 2-4% annually through burn mechanisms
**Scarcity Premium**: Increasing token value through controlled deflation
**Velocity Optimization**: Staking incentives reduce active circulation
**Long-term Value**: Deflationary pressure supports price appreciation

## 7. DEFLATIONARY ECONOMICS

### 7.1 Token Burn Mechanisms

#### Systematic Burn Schedule

**Automatic Burn Categories**:

```
Monthly Token Burns:
├── Transaction Fee Burns (40%): 2% of all platform fees
├── Penalty Burns (25%): Violation-based token destruction
├── Milestone Burns (20%): Community achievement celebrations
├── Buyback Burns (10%): Profit-based token purchases and burns
└── Governance Burns (5%): Community-voted special burns

Projected Annual Burns:
├── Year 1: 50,000,000 GTT (2% of total supply)
├── Year 2: 75,000,000 GTT (3% of remaining supply)
├── Year 3: 100,000,000 GTT (4% of remaining supply)
├── Year 4: 120,000,000 GTT (5% of remaining supply)
└── Year 5: 150,000,000 GTT (6% of remaining supply)

Total 5-Year Burn: 495,000,000 GTT (19.8% of original supply)
```

#### Economic Impact Analysis

**Deflationary Pressure Calculation**:

```
Effective Supply Reduction = (Burned Tokens + Staked Tokens) / Circulating Supply

Year 1 Analysis:
├── Circulating Supply: 1,200,000,000 GTT
├── Burned Tokens: 50,000,000 GTT
├── Staked Tokens: 400,000,000 GTT
└── Effective Reduction: 37.5% supply pressure

Price Impact Estimation:
Assuming constant demand, 37.5% supply reduction could drive:
├── Conservative Estimate: 25-40% price appreciation
├── Moderate Estimate: 50-75% price appreciation
└── Optimistic Estimate: 100-150% price appreciation
```

### 7.2 Staking Economics

#### Staking Reward Structure

**Multi-Tier Staking System**:

```
Staking Tiers & Annual Rewards:
├── Validator Staking (500,000+ GTT): 20% APY + governance rights
├── Premium Staking (100,000+ GTT): 15% APY + priority features
├── Advanced Staking (50,000+ GTT): 12% APY + advanced tools
├── Standard Staking (10,000+ GTT): 8% APY + basic benefits
└── Basic Staking (1,000+ GTT): 5% APY + staking rewards

Lock-up Bonuses:
├── 30 days: +0% bonus (base rate)
├── 90 days: +25% bonus (6.25% APY becomes 7.8% APY)
├── 180 days: +50% bonus (8% APY becomes 12% APY)
├── 365 days: +100% bonus (15% APY becomes 30% APY)
└── 730 days: +150% bonus (20% APY becomes 50% APY)
```

#### Staking Pool Dynamics

**Reward Pool Management**:

```
Monthly Staking Reward Pool: 50,000,000 GTT

├── Average Lock Period: Target 180+ days
├── Reward Inflation Rate: 2-3% annually
└── Pool Refill Rate: From platform revenue
```

### 7.3 Velocity Control Mechanisms

#### Circulation Reduction Strategies

**Active Circulation Management**:

- **Staking Incentives**: High APY rates encourage long-term holding
- **Utility Requirements**: Platform features require GTT holdings
- **Governance Participation**: Voting requires minimum GTT stakes
- **Premium Access**: Advanced features locked behind GTT requirements

**Velocity Optimization Targets**:

```
Token Velocity Management:
├── Current Velocity: 2.5x annually (4.8 month average hold)
├── Target Velocity: 1.5x annually (8 month average hold)
├── Mechanism: Increased staking incentives and utility
