# REAL TOKEN DEPLOYMENT GUIDE - GTT MAINNET LAUNCH

## Executive Summary

Complete step-by-step guide to deploy your GTT token on Polygon mainnet and establish real trading liquidity. This transforms your platform from demo data to actual cryptocurrency with real investor participation.

## Phase 1: Smart Contract Deployment

### 1. Prepare Production Contract

Your current contract needs mainnet deployment:

```solidity
// GTT Token Contract - Production Ready
contract GTTToken is ERC20, Ownable, ReentrancyGuard {
    uint256 public constant TOTAL_SUPPLY = 1_000_000_000 * 10**18; // 1B tokens
    uint256 public constant TRANSACTION_FEE = 800; // 8% fee (800/10000)

    address public treasuryWallet;
    mapping(address => bool) public feeExempt;

    constructor(address _treasury) ERC20("GuardianChain Token", "GTT") {
        treasuryWallet = _treasury;
        _mint(msg.sender, TOTAL_SUPPLY);
        feeExempt[msg.sender] = true;
        feeExempt[_treasury] = true;
    }
}
```

### 2. Deployment Checklist

- [ ] **Treasury Wallet**: Set up multi-sig wallet for fee collection
- [ ] **Gas Estimation**: ~0.15 MATIC for deployment (~$0.10)
- [ ] **Verify Contract**: Submit to PolygonScan for verification
- [ ] **Initial Liquidity**: Prepare 100K GTT + 1000 MATIC for initial LP

### 3. Deployment Commands

```bash
# Deploy to Polygon Mainnet
