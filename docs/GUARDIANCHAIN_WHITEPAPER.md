- **Total Supply**: 2.5 billion GTT tokens
- **Launch Price**: $0.0075 per GTT
- **Target Market Cap**: $25M-75M within 90 days
- **Trading Volume Goal**: $100K in first 24 hours
- **Revenue Streams**: 4 primary channels generating immediate cash flow

    uint8 public decimals = 18;
    uint256 public totalSupply = 2500000000 * 10**18;
    
    // Advanced features
    mapping(address => uint256) public reputationScores;
    mapping(address => bool) public verifiedCreators;
    
    function stakingRewards(address user) external view returns (uint256);
