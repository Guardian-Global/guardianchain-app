// GUARDIANCHAIN FULL LEGACY FIX + ULTIMATE HOMEPAGE UPGRADE
// Navigation-integrated. Investor-ready. All legacy issues repaired.

// üß† OBJECTIVE:
Use the new MegaSidebar + WalkthroughNav system to:
1. Traverse every route listed in ROUTES.ts
2. Inject or restore all missing features, logic, capsule types, and IP components
3. Repair or completely rewrite broken/incomplete legacy pages
4. Connect missing AI/metrics/yield/token logic
5. Use updated layout and walkthrough system site-wide

// üîç HOMEPAGE TASK (HIGH PRIORITY):
A. Crawl all existing homepage and landing files (`/index.tsx`, `/pages/home.tsx`, etc.)
B. Compare them to industry-standard landing pages from:
   - Ethereum.org
   - Mirror.xyz
   - Arweave
   - OpenSea
   - Vercel
C. Identify the top 5 layouts that are:
   - Visually powerful
   - User onboarding-friendly
   - High-converting
   - Investor-attractive
D. Merge the top UX patterns into one elite homepage:
   - Includes hero section with video
   - Clear explanation of capsules, GTT, and permanence
   - AI-powered call-to-actions
   - Trust signals (VC-backed, on-chain verified)
   - Testimonials or user examples
   - Social share CTA
E. Permanently remove unused legacy homepage files to avoid fallback or routing errors (especially `/home.tsx`, `/landing.tsx`, `/welcome.tsx`)

// ‚úÖ CAPSULE + TOKEN FIX INSTRUCTIONS:
- Fill in all missing capsule types (time-lock, death-switch, contract seal, whistleblower)
- Enable the Eternal Contract capsule flow to be publicly shareable and unlockable by ENS
- Inject token yield logic from `GTTYieldVault.sol` into the dashboard
- Fill `/tokenomics`, `/tokens`, `/metrics`, `/dashboard/yield` with live data and connect API
- Migrate/merge old token docs into `/whitepapers` if not yet imported

// üìÇ FILE SOURCES TO RESPECT:
- `guardian_registry.json` ‚Üí lists all declared capsules/stacks
- `veritus_feature_sync.sh` ‚Üí all expected enabled features
- `fullstack.txt`, `token logicrrr.txt`, `VC-GSAL`, `Phase15` docs ‚Üí all IP
- `WalkthroughContext.tsx` ‚Üí use to highlight CTA flow: Create ‚Üí Lock ‚Üí Yield

// üö´ DO NOT:
- Leave placeholder or incomplete files (delete or complete them)
- Create new pages if existing legacy files exist (prefer to rewrite)
- Allow multiple homepages to co-exist (finalize one)

// ‚úÖ DO:
- Inject all restored content using the new layout: AppLayout.tsx + MegaSidebar
- Apply WalkthroughStepper to `/create`, `/eternal-contracts`, `/dashboard/yield`
- Enable multilingual support from `locales/en.json`, `es.json`, and tooltip hooks
- Use Breadcrumbs and TopbarCommandMenu site-wide for UX clarity
- Match Ethereum.org-level frontend clarity, code quality, and style

// ‚úÖ OUTPUT GOAL:
- Fully merged homepage based on best 5 options
- All dead legacy home files deleted
- Every route functional
- All missing capsule types and token logic wired in
- Entire app uses upgraded layout + walkthrough
- Ready to pitch investors or receive grant/VC review
