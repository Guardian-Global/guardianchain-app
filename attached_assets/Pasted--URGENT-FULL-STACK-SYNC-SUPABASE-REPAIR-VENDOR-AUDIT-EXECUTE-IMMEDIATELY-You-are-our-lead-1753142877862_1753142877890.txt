üö® URGENT: FULL-STACK SYNC, SUPABASE REPAIR & VENDOR AUDIT ‚Äî EXECUTE IMMEDIATELY

You are our lead full-stack AI engineer. Over the next 1 hour, perform the following:

1. üîê **Import All Environment Variables**  
   - SESSION_SECRET, SUPABASE service keys, ALCHEMY, INFURA, STRIPE, POSTHOG, PINATA, ANTHROPIC, REPLICATE, TOGETHER_AI, RESEND, DUNE, PLAUSIBLE, DOCUSIGN, META, THIRDWEB, HELIO, OPENAI, CLOUDINARY, CLOUDFLARE, WEB3AUTH, ETHERSCAN, AUTH0, POLYGON_RPC_URL, PRIVATE_KEY, SMTP, DATABASE, JWT, MASTER_ADMIN, OAUTH, PASSWORD_PEPPER, PRIVATE_KEY_USER, VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY  
   - Validate presence and accessibility in project.

2. ‚úÖ **Supabase Audit & Healing**
   - Connect using `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` + `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`.
   - Validate `auth.users` for tier metadata, email confirmation, password reset.
   - Clean or repair tables: `capsules`, `capsule_rewards`, `user_profiles`, `transaction_history`, GTT-specific yield/staking tables.
   - Fix orphaned rows, enforce FK constraints, purge malformed dummy data.
   - Verify real-time subscriptions and RLS policies ‚Äî fix broken event listeners or blocked writes.

3. ‚öôÔ∏è **Vendor Integration Audit**
   - **Web3 RPC**: Confirm `ALCHEMY_RPC_URL`, `INFURA_PROJECT_ID`, and `POLYGON_RPC_URL` are valid and responding.
   - **Stripe**: Validate `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, chargeability, tier payment flows.
   - **PostHog Analytics**: Validate `POSTHOG_API_KEY`, `HOST`, `STRIPE_ACCOUNT_ID`, working event tracking.
   - **Pinata**: Validate pinning and gateway access for storage assets.
   - **Anthropic/Replicate/OpenAI**: Validate AI endpoints working with their keys.
   - **Cloudinary & Cloudflare**: Validate media upload and asset delivery.

4. ‚úÖ **Frontend-Backend Sync**
   - Visit `https://guardianchain.app` and validate user flows end-to-end: signup, login, tier purchase, capsule view, yield calculation.
   - Ensure real-time UI matches Supabase state and on-chain data.

5. ‚ö°Ô∏è **Clinical Repairs & Fixes**
   - Generate SQL migration scripts or Supabase API patch calls to fix inconsistencies.
   - Patch any broken RLS or API policies.
   - Provide console logs and health check outputs for each vendor endpoint.

6. üß™ **Verify & Report**
   - Run a live health-check script (works with Supabase and Web3) and output to console.
   - Summarize: what was repaired, what remains broken, and what's still failing.
   - If any vendor is misconfigured or inaccessible, flag it clearly.

‚è± **Execute now** and provide real-time updates:  
- SQL fixes  
- Patch code  
- Health-check console logs  
- Final summary report: ‚úÖ All good, or üî¥ Needs attention.

Begin immediately ‚Äî our system is counting on this. üöÄ
