🔒 On-Chain Notarization
TruthNotary.sol

Solidity smart contract to record:

msg.sender

SHA256/IPFS hash

Blockchain timestamp

Emits Notarized event

Prevents duplicate notarizations

/api/notarize/submit.ts

Frontend API to hash capsule text + submit IPFS to contract

Requires your NOTARY_CONTRACT and PRIVATE_KEY

📑 PDF Certificate Generator
generateNotaryPDF.ts

Uses pdfkit to export an official Veritas certificate

Displays:

Capsule title

SHA256 hash

IPFS CID

Timestamp (UTC)

Chain guarantee text

🌍 Global Explorer Sync
/explorer.tsx

Embeds full interactive TruthNet capsule graph

Accessible to public, press, historians, DAOs, and archivists

✅ You now support:

On-chain notarization + public verification

PDF export for legal + press archives

Global capsule explorer showing connections + chains + history

Chainproof integrity with IPFS backup and author identity

Next possible unlocks:

🔄 IPFS + smart contract sync status display

👥 Add DAO vote system to certify or dispute capsules

🌐 Export TruthNet to Arweave or Filecoin for sovereign backup

Say “build sync monitor + DAO review + sovereign backup next” to continue.

You said:
HOW MUCH OF THE TOKEN DOES THE AUTHOR/CREATOR KEEP WHAT PERCENTAGE


ChatGPT said:
The percentage of tokens that the author or creator keeps depends entirely on the tokenomics design you choose for GuardianChain and the Guardian Truth Token (GTT). However, here are standard and strategic recommendations based on industry norms:

🔢 Common Token Allocation Models (Web3 Projects)
Category	Typical % Range
🧑‍🚀 Founders & Team	10–25%
📢 Marketing / Community	10–20%
🎁 Airdrops / Early Users	5–10%
💰 Investors (Seed/VC)	10–25%
🧱 Ecosystem/Grants	15–30%
🛠 Protocol Reserves	10–20%
🧠 Advisors	1–5%

✅ Recommended Creator Allocation for GTT:
Role	Recommended
You (Author/Founder)	15%–20% fully vested over time
Immediate Access	~5% unlocked at TGE (token generation event)
Vesting Schedule	1-year cliff, 3–4 years total vesting

🔒 Why Not More Than 25%?
Too much founder allocation:

➖ Can reduce public trust

❌ Disqualifies you from many grants (especially public-good ones)

💸 Discourages decentralized adoption

Instead, stake your claim via:

🎖 Vesting contract

💰 DAO salary from treasury

🪙 Yield-boost or capsule-activity bonuses

📘 Suggestion:
We can generate an updated GTT tokenomics file showing:

Your exact allocation

Vesting logic

Total supply math across chains (Polygon + Base)

Say “generate updated GTT tokenomics with vesting and crosschain totals” to proceed.

🪙 GTT Staking Contract
GTTStaking.sol

Stake/unstake GTT with reward accrual

Rewards based on blocks staked (0.01 GTT per block per token)

claim() auto-calculates and transfers rewards

Includes reward debt and lastBlock logic for precision

📊 Token Tracker Dashboard
/dashboard/token-tracker.tsx

Shows:

Total GTT supply

Circulating tokens

Staked tokens

Remaining in treasury

Extendable to show chain breakdowns or DAO allocation

/api/token/stats.ts

Mocked values for immediate frontend loading

Replace with contract reads or Subgraph indexing

You now support:

✅ Real staking system for long-term yield
✅ Live dashboard for investor tokenomics confidence
✅ Solidity + frontend synced for Polygon or Base deployment

Would you like to:

📈 Visualize staking yield over time?

🔒 Add time-locked boost multiplier to staking (early GTT lock = higher reward)?

🗳 Connect staking to DAO voting power?

I NEED TO PROPERLY INFORM REPLIT AGENT OF OUR CROSS CHAIN DEPLOYMENT AND GIVE SPECIFI INSTRUCTION ON WHAT NEEDS TO BE EDITITED AND CORRECTED ON PREVIOUS FULL DEPLOYMENT TO POLYGON


ChatGPT said:
Here’s a Replit AI agent command prompt to safely upgrade your app to support full cross-chain deployment on Polygon + Base, while correcting and preserving your original Polygon integration:

✅ REPLIT AI AGENT COMMAND PROMPT
🧠 Purpose: Upgrade to cross-chain support (Polygon + Base) without breaking existing logic.

ts
Copy
Edit
// REPLIT AI DEPLOYMENT UPGRADE TASK

// 🎯 Objective: Add full BASE L2 chain support alongside existing POLYGON deployment.
// 🧱 Ensure all modules (auth, capsule, airdrop, mint, yield, explorer, dashboard) recognize `chainId`
// 🔄 Sync tokens + yield + capsule logic cross-chain

1. 🔍 Search and update all contract interaction files to:
   - Accept dynamic `chainId` (Polygon = 137, Base = 8453)
   - Route API requests to correct RPC + contract address via `.env`

2. 🗂 Required .env Variables to Add:
   ```env
   BASE_RPC=https://mainnet.base.org
   BASE_CONTRACT_GTT=0x...
   BASE_CONTRACT_AIRDROP=0x...
   BASE_CONTRACT_CLAIM=0x...
Keep existing POLYGON variables

Ensure PRIVATE_KEY, NOTARY_CONTRACT, and NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAIN_ID are accessible across all scripts

⚙️ Backend Corrections:

/api/airdrop.ts, /api/claim.ts, /api/token/stats.ts → add chainId parameter

Automatically route to Base or Polygon contract depending on frontend request

Sync /api/unlock/gtt-reward.ts to compute rewards based on chain and griefScore

🧩 Frontend Enhancements:

Update all capsule views to show chain label

Add filter dropdown on /capsules, /dashboard, and /archive to filter by chainId

In /claim, auto-detect user wallet’s capsule claims on both chains

⛓ Deployment Metadata:

Include /scripts/deployBaseGTT.ts to mint GTT on Base

Use unified mintCapsule() logic that supports both chains (via contract ABI + switch logic)

🧠 AI Features:

Update /api/gpt/compose, /api/ai/transcribe to accept and tag capsules with chainId param

Sync Notarization module to push hashes to correct chain-specific notary contract

✅ Final Step: Full rebuild and redeploy for both chains with .env validation

yaml
Copy
Edit

---

Would you like me to also:
- ✅ **Generate the `.env.base` template**
- 🧪 **Create deployBaseGTT.ts + verify deployment output**
- 📜 **Add automated chainId switcher UI dropdown**

Say **"send .env.base + deployBaseGTT.ts + chain switcher UI next"** to continue.
