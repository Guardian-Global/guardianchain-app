egin critical system upgrade. Unify all authentication, onboarding, and tiered access for GuardianChain.

Eliminate all redundant and legacy login, sign-up, master access, and tiered entry points.

No more multiple or separate pages, buttons, or “Master/Admin” login screens.

The entire platform—including admin, enterprise, and user tiers—must authenticate and access services through a single, unified entry point (a single “Login / Sign Up” modal or page).

Implement ONE logical authentication/authorization flow for ALL users:

User selects “Sign Up” or “Sign In.”

After authentication, system determines user’s role/tier based on their subscription or admin status.

Route user to the correct dashboard or onboarding flow based on their tier (Free, Pro, Enterprise, Admin, etc.).

Subscription/Tiered Access:

After login, dynamically display only the features and options the user’s subscription allows—no more mismatched access, upgrade nags, or feature confusion.

Onboarding, dashboard, and feature visibility should be determined by the authenticated session, not by entry point.

Upgrade/downgrade options should be clear but not invasive.

Admin/Master Access:

“Admin/Master” is a user tier, NOT a separate entry point or form.

If user’s credentials have admin privileges, show admin dashboard/features after unified login, not through a separate “Master Access” screen.

UI/UX Requirements:

Replace all redundant links in header/footer/nav with a single “Login / Sign Up” button.

No user (including founder/admin) should ever see more than one entry point to authentication.

All future account, profile, or subscription flows must branch after the unified login/auth—never before.

Onboarding:

After first login, route users through onboarding tailored to their tier (Free: quick tour; Pro: feature highlights; Enterprise: KYC/compliance; Admin: platform overview, health stats).

Security:

Harden all authentication and session management logic; ensure no bypass or privilege escalation is possible.

Log all auth and role transitions for admin/founder review.

Testing and Deployment:

Run full regression test on authentication, session handling, and feature gating for all roles.

Report to founder with a summary of code changes and screenshots of the unified experience before going live.

Goal:
Achieve a world-class, unified authentication and tiered access system that matches the best in SaaS and web3—one gate in, branching out to the correct experience for every user, no exceptions.

Addendum:
All redundant UI elements, links, or modals for login/signup/admin/master access should be removed from the codebase and UI.

All future upgrades to onboarding or feature access should hook into this unified system.
