<Callout type="impact" icon="üìà">
  <b>GuardianChain‚Äôs Yield Engine is the world‚Äôs first protocol for programmable, proof-bound, and fully auditable economic rewards‚Äîavailable to all contributors and validated by AI.</b>
</Callout>
- All rewards are algorithmic, on-chain, and governed by the DAO
- Instant, role-aware feedback and simulation for yield scenarios

## <span id="yield-flow">Yield Flow & Architecture <YieldIcon /></span>
<AnimatedChart src="/media/yield-flow-chart.svg" interactive />
- **Capsule Authors:** Earn GTT for high-quality, demand-driven memory capsules
- **Validators:** Rewards scale with uptime, accuracy, and network value
- **Community Contributors:** Bug bounties, open-source, governance actions

<Callout type="pro" icon="üí°">
  Visualize live protocol rewards above, or try custom scenarios below.

## <span id="yield-simulator">Yield Simulator <SimulateIcon /></span>
<YieldSimulator />
- Choose your role, input activity, and see real-time reward estimates
- Compare validator, author, and community scenarios

<LiveStats type="validator-stats" />
<LiveStats type="author-stats" />

## <span id="dao-parameters">DAO Governance & Dynamic Parameters <DAOBadge /></span>
- All yield parameters (pools, caps, multipliers) are set by on-chain DAO vote
- View, propose, or comment on live parameter proposals: <LiveVote proposal="yield-params" />
- Quantum-audited adjustment logs, instantly viewable by role

<AuditTrail doc="yield-engine" />

## <span id="future">Future-Proof Features <FutureIcon /></span>
- Personalized yield, tax, and compliance dashboards (wallet-connected)
- AI fraud detection and reward/penalty auto-reporting
- Global, cross-protocol yield comparison (open-source API)
- DAO-governed reward innovations: inflation protection, ‚Äúyield as a service,‚Äù ESG weighting

## <span id="faq">FAQ <HelpIcon /></span>
<FAQ>
  <Question q="How is yield calculated?">Based on capsule quality, validator uptime, network demand, and DAO-set parameters. See simulator above.</Question>
  <Question q="Can I suggest changes?">Yes. Use the DAO proposal tool, or submit feedback in the chat overlay.</Question>
  <Question q="Is all data public?">Yes. Every reward, penalty, and distribution is on-chain and can be searched or exported.</Question>
  <Question q="Are there risks to yield?">All risks (slashing, penalty, parameter change) are shown in real time and are DAO governed.</Question>
</FAQ>

## <span id="audit">Audit, Version, and Proof-of-Authorship NFT <AuditIcon /></span>
- All reward events, changes, and DAO votes are versioned, timestamped, and NFT-minted for authorship
- Download or compare any version: <AuditTrail doc="yield-engine" />
