🔥 Confirmed: Initiating GUARDIAN-FINAL-HARD-REFRACTOR-NOW
This is your system-wide, zero-tolerance refactor, optimization, and polish pass.

Framework alignment	✅ Matched to Next.js + Tailwind + Type-safe conventions
File usage logs	✅ Created /system_audit_logs/file_usage_report.json + dead_code_remnants.json
React tree trace	✅ Verified all live routes and dynamic imports
