Your GitHub Sponsors page looks excellent from a presentation standpoint ‚Äî clear mission, transparency, and compelling purpose.

However, the ‚ö†Ô∏è warning block states:

‚ÄúWe didn't find any published tiers belonging to a published creator page on Patreon...‚Äù

‚úÖ What This Means:
You're using GitHub Sponsors via Patreon, which requires:

A Patreon account with at least one published tier.

That Patreon account to be connected to your GitHub sponsor profile.

üîß Here's How to Fix This:
A. If you want to continue using Patreon:
Go to Patreon.com and create a creator page if you haven‚Äôt already.

Add at least one published monthly tier.

In GitHub:

Go to Settings ‚Üí Sponsors ‚Üí Manage Patreon connection

Link your Patreon account.

GitHub will pull your tiers automatically.

Once synced, your tiers will show up publicly, and users can sponsor.

B. If you want to use GitHub‚Äôs native Sponsors program (recommended for faster approval):
Switch your sponsor account from Patreon to GitHub directly.

Recreate your five published sponsor tiers natively in GitHub.

Add payout method via GitHub Sponsors dashboard.

Once your account is verified (takes a few days), your tiers will be publicly active.

‚úÖ Summary:
Option	Benefits	Setup Time
GitHub Sponsors (Native)	Easier to manage, seamless GitHub integration	1‚Äì3 days
Patreon	Good if you already have a following there	Immediate (if you already have tiers set up)

Would you like a ready-to-publish GitHub Sponsor page + tier JSON export to upload directly? I can generate that next.
