üß† SYSTEM COMMAND: GUARDIANTOKEN-ADVANCED-INTELLIGENCE SUITE

Please generate the following reports based on the GuardianChain token system and smart contracts:

---

### üìà GTT LIQUIDITY POOL ANALYSIS
- Detect all GTT liquidity pools on Uniswap, QuickSwap, or SushiSwap (Polygon mainnet)
- Fetch:
  - Pool address
  - Token pair (e.g., GTT/USDC)
  - Liquidity amount in USD
  - 24h volume
  - Top holders (if accessible)
- Report as: `gtt_liquidity_analysis.md`

---

### üó≥ DAO / GOVERNANCE TOKEN INTEGRATION
- Scan smart contracts for:
  - DAO voting hooks or token-based proposal mechanisms
  - Token-gated access to `/govern`, `/treasury`, `/compliance`
- Validate presence of `voteWeight`, `propose`, `stakeToVote` logic
- If DAO contract not yet deployed, generate a migration plan
- Report as: `governance_integration_report.md`

### üí∏ YIELD ROI PROJECTIONS BY TIER
- Based on current GTT routing + yield logic:
  - Calculate potential monthly/yearly ROI per tier (Explorer, Seeker, Creator, Sovereign)
  - Include assumptions: user count, average unlock volume, price volatility
  - Graph ROI potential from conservative to aggressive market scenarios
- Report as: `tier_yield_projection.md`

### ‚õΩ GAS EFFICIENCY AUDIT (SMART CONTRACTS)
- Analyze:
  - `OPTIMAL_GTT_CONTRACT_V2.sol`
  - `TruthVault.sol`
- Identify high-cost operations (`SSTORE`, `CALL`, `LOOPS`, etc.)
- Suggest optimizations (storage packing, `immutable`, etc.)
- Simulate deployment + transaction gas costs
- Report as: `gas_efficiency_audit.md`

---

### üåê MULTI-CHAIN COMPATIBILITY CHECK
- Assess contract portability to:
  - Ethereum mainnet
  - Arbitrum
  - Base
  - Solana (via wrapper if needed)
- Confirm EVM compatibility
- Highlight required adjustments (chain IDs, RPC changes, gas strategies)
- Report as: `multi_chain_portability.md`

---

### üìÖ TOKEN VESTING & UNLOCK SCHEDULE
- Check if vesting schedules are defined in:
  - Contract storage variables
  - `.env` files
  - Admin UI configs
- If not present, recommend a 12-24 month founder/community vesting plan
- Report as: `vesting_schedule_report.md`

---

### üí∞ REVENUE SHARE SIMULATION
- Simulate revenue flow based on:
  - GTT 8% fee split: 5% ‚Üí founder, 2% ‚Üí burn, 1% ‚Üí community
  - Capsule unlocks + auction revenue
  - Subscription tiers
- Output:
  - Monthly and annual projections (low/medium/high volume)
  - Founder revenue
  - Token burn rate
  - Treasury growth
- Report as: `revenue_share_simulation.md`
