# GuardianChain: Truth Lineage Protocol Addendum

### Overview
GuardianChain’s core innovation has always been sealing sovereign memory. This addendum introduces a powerful extension: the **Truth Lineage Graph** — a decentralized protocol to track influence, inheritance, and grief transmission across memory capsules.

---

### 1. Motivation
While NFTs prove authorship, and DAOs prove consensus, **GuardianChain proves influence.** It links capsules across time into a cryptographic memory tree — visualizing how trauma, courage, or truth propagate through society.

---

### 2. Capsule Lineage Infrastructure
- **Each capsule** may contain:
  - `inspired_by`: ID of the capsule that influenced its creation
  - `grief_inherited`: grief tier transferred
  - `influence_score`: % match to parent capsule's content/emotion
- **Lineage Table** logs:
  - `parent_id`, `child_id`, `grief_flow`, `influence_score`, `triggered_by`
  - Timestamped and replay-linked

---

### 3. Visual Interface
- **Lineage Graph View**: Shows capsule-to-capsule relationships
- **Replay-Create Workflow**: Auto-logs lineage from replay to creation
- **OpenSea Link + Veritas Cert**: Each node links to full capsule data

---

### 4. Truth Yield Propagation
- Replaying and minting a child capsule **triggers micro-yield** to the parent:
  - 5% of grief-based GTT to parent wallet
  - Optional 1% to grandparent
  - Configurable yield path
- Smart contract: `distributeYield(address,uint256)` emits via GTTYieldVault

---

### 5. Impact Certificate NFTs
Auto-issued when a capsule achieves:
- 3+ descendants (forks)
- 50+ GTT indirectly earned
- Verified influence across multiple wallets

These soulbound NFTs are **Proof-of-Influence**, with grief lineage, replay count, and sealed Veritas hash.

### 6. Applications
- 🌍 Whistleblower memory paths
- 🎓 Grief literacy graphs in education
- 🧬 Trauma transmission research
- 🎖 Survivor merit-based yield
- 🧠 AI-verified emotional network tracing

---

### 7. Technical Summary
- Postgres + Supabase native schema
- Fully wrapped React UI with ReactFlow
- AI scoring from OpenAI / Claude used for influence matching
- Role-based replay, auto-linking, and lineage integrity locking

---

### 8. Ecosystem Advantage
This system turns GuardianChain into a **living, generative truth economy** — not only sealing memory but tracing its ripple effect across people, wallets, grief, and time.

### Grant Fit:
- 🏛 Cultural Heritage & Sovereignty (Arweave, Filecoin)
- 📚 Education, Grief & Wellness (Gitcoin, Ethereum Foundation)
- 🌐 Human Rights, Veritas Labs, Journalism (UNICEF, ConsenSys)

Let truth remember what we forget.
Let memory yield what grief preserved.
