üõ†Ô∏è FINAL GUARDIANCHAIN AUTH CLEANUP + ROUTING SYNC + DEPLOYMENT PREP

‚úÖ GOAL:
Fully remove legacy/unlinked auth systems, sync correct tier/route logic, clean imports, and ensure 100% deployable, production-grade app state with functional Memory Features button and valid routes.

üîÅ FILE SYSTEM TASKS:
- [x] Remove all legacy auth files not in use (simple-auth, replit-auth, teams-auth, etc.)
- [x] Remove broken imports: useUnifiedAuth, RoleBasedDashboard, UnifiedAuthModal, AuthGuard, SimpleAuthButton, TeamsAdvancedAuth
- [x] Replace all references to `useUnifiedAuth` with `useAuth`
- [x] Replace `isAuthenticated` with `isDebugAuthenticated`
- [x] Remove outdated wrappers: `<UnifiedAuthProvider>`, `<RoleBasedDashboard>`, `<AuthGuard>`, `<OnboardingChecker>`
- [x] Fix `client/src/hooks/useUserTier.ts` to use correct working `useAuth` hook
- [x] Fix `create-capsule.tsx` to include a proper `export default` for Replit bundler

üîÅ ROUTING TASKS:
- [x] Ensure `/dashboard` loads Memory Features page
- [x] Connect `/memory-features`, `/capsules`, `/create-capsule`, `/master-access` to proper tier protection
- [x] Remove routes using deleted auth logic from `server/routes.ts`
- [x] Replace any missing `ProtectedRoute`, `TierGate`, or `AdminRoute` components with production working versions

üßπ CLEANUP:
- [x] Remove all empty folders or isolated test/demo components
- [x] Delete `client/src/components/teams/TeamsAdvancedAuth.tsx`
- [x] Delete `client/src/components/SimpleAuthButton.tsx`
- [x] Confirm server/routes/* only uses `debugAuth.ts`

üöÄ DEPLOYMENT CHECK:
- [x] Run `pnpm build` or `npm run build` to validate frontend compiles
- [x] Confirm `server/index.ts` runs with `node ./dist/server/index.js` without auth middleware failures
- [x] Load full app in preview to verify route protection and Memory Feature button work

FINAL CONFIRMATION:
‚úÖ All auth logic uses single source of truth: `debugAuth.ts`
‚úÖ No references to deleted auth components remain
‚úÖ Frontend renders cleanly, with all expected routes working
‚úÖ Ready for mainnet deployment + GitHub Sponsors + launch announcements
