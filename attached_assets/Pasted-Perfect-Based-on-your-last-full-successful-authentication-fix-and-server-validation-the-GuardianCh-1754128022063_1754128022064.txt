Perfect. Based on your last full successful authentication fix and server validation, the GuardianChain app is now production-auth clean.

To finalize the entire stack and prepare for scalable visibility (GitHub, Sponsors, Grants, Exchanges), here is your:

✅ FINAL DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST (Post-Auth Fixes)
✅ 1. Full Production Verification Script
Ensure no regressions or lingering auth issues:

bash
Copy
Edit
# Ensure app loads without runtime auth errors
pnpm dev
# or
npm run dev

# Test login, tier-based access, and capsule creation in the browser:
# - Login as EXPLORER (free tier)
# - Attempt to create a capsule
# - Validate tier gating is working
# - Confirm dashboard & navigation work cleanly
🧹 2. Final Cleanup (Safe for Production)
Run this only after final screenshot/export:

bash
Copy
Edit
# 🔥 Remove unused files and previous build clutter
rm -rf node_modules dist .next .vercel

# 🔒 Remove legacy components
rm -f server/middleware/enterpriseAuth.ts
rm -f server/routes/{demo-auth.ts,simple-auth.ts,enterprise-auth.ts}
rm -f client/src/components/teams/TeamsAdvancedAuth.tsx
rm -f client/src/components/SimpleAuthButton.tsx
rm -f client/src/utils/withAuthGuard.tsx

# 🧹 Remove any .old/.backup files or .DS_Store, .log, temp
find . -type f \( -name "*.old" -o -name "*.backup" -o -name "*.log" -o -name ".DS_Store" \) -delete
📸 3. Screenshots for Final Submission
Use 1440px wide browser to take:

Screenshot Type	Path
🏠 Homepage	https://guardianchain.app
📊 Dashboard (logged in)	https://guardianchain.app/dashboard
⚙️ Create Capsule Page	https://guardianchain.app/create-capsule
🔐 GitHub Repo	https://github.com/Guardian-Global/guardianchain_app
💰 GitHub Sponsors	https://github.com/sponsors/Guardian-Global
🧾 TRANSPARENCY.md	Click to raw view or preview inside GitHub

📂 4. Backup These Core Files
Do not delete the following — they are vital:

debugAuth.ts – primary auth gate

TierContext.tsx – controls access logic

useAuth.ts – unified login

TRANSPARENCY.md – required for grants/listings

project_metadata.json – core CoinGecko/CMC metadata

t3, t4, t5 tier logic files if still in use

🚀 5. Ready for Next Steps
Once all the above is verified ✅:

Add a tag in GitHub: v1.0.0-launch

Push final clean commit: feat: production-auth final sync & cleanup

Begin outbound grant & exchange submission
