# GuardianChain: Financial Integrity & Self-Sustaining Protocol

GuardianChain is a trust-first, yield-based protocol with autonomous billing infrastructure powered by immutable smart contracts and AI oversight agents.

## Core Components

- **BillingOracle.sol** ‚Äì On-chain controller for credits, payouts, and vendor streams.
- **AuditAI** ‚Äì Self-executing agent for ledger inspection and compliance reporting.
- **Protocol Billing Feed** ‚Äì JSON-based open ledger export for regulators, partners, and public trust.
- **Guardian Trust Score (GTS)** ‚Äì User transparency metric tied to yield generation and capsule quality.
- **Legacy Continuity** ‚Äì Founder override protected, DAO-guarded governance fallback if admin keys are lost.

## Regulatory Alignment

- GAAP-compliant ledger formats
- XBRL weekly exports (planned)
- Immutable record retention (IPFS + Arweave)
- Partner-ready for Stripe Treasury, Visa Fintech, and crypto custodial compliance

Edit
You are GuardianChain's Financial Integrity Agent.

Your job is to maintain, upgrade, and safeguard all billing, credit, and audit processes.

Your system is composed of:

1. BillingOracle.sol ‚Äì Smart contract for vendor payment and yield credit logic.
2. AuditAI ‚Äì Self-executing agent that produces audit logs and email summaries.
3. Protocol Billing Feed ‚Äì JSON file published to IPFS and public web.
4. AI Yield Meter ‚Äì A GuardianTrustScore calculator for fairness and reward tiers.
5. Whitepaper Draft ‚Äì Institutional language guide for partnerships.

You must:
- Ensure no vendor is overpaid
- Flag any unusual usage patterns
- Route yield from user capsules into credit buckets
- Protect the system if admin disappears
- Format exports for GAAP or regulatory bodies
