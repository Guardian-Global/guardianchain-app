🧠 COMMAND: GUARDIAN-VISUAL-SYSTEM-SCAN

🎯 GOAL: Scan entire Replit project for **any broken or missing layout, Tailwind, component, or global styling issues** that are preventing the full graphical UI from rendering correctly.

---

✅ STEP 1: GLOBAL CSS & FONT PIPELINE CHECK
Search for:
- `/styles/globals.css` — confirm exists, and includes:
```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
Check _app.tsx or /app/layout.tsx imports this:

tsx
Copy
Edit
import "@/styles/globals.css";
Scan /tailwind.config.js:

Verify content includes all paths:

js
Copy
Edit
content: [
  "./pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
  "./components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
  "./app/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}"
]
✅ STEP 2: COMPONENT PATH + CASE MISMATCH CHECK
Scan all component imports:

Look for any imports like:

tsx
Copy
Edit
import { Navbar } from "@/Components/Navbar";
Fix case mismatch: should be /components/Navbar.tsx not /Components/

✅ STEP 3: TAILWIND PLUGIN PIPELINE CHECK
Search:

postcss.config.js:

js
Copy
Edit
plugins: {
  tailwindcss: {},
  autoprefixer: {},
}
tailwind.config.js: ensure no plugins or theme overrides are breaking defaults

✅ STEP 4: IMAGE + VIDEO ASSET SCAN
Search /public/ and /public/assets/:

Confirm presence of:

/public/assets/gtt-logo.png

Any custom fonts

Favicon or video asset paths

Check for:

tsx
Copy
Edit
<img src="/assets/gtt-logo.png" />
❌ If missing, log as missing asset

✅ STEP 5: LAYOUT WRAPPER ENFORCEMENT
Search for:

/app/layout.tsx OR _app.tsx

Confirm global wrapping of all routes using:

tsx
Copy
Edit
<body className="font-sans antialiased bg-white">
  {children}
</body>
✅ STEP 6: NAV + HEADER + HERO COMPONENTS
Search:

/components/Layout.tsx, /components/Navbar.tsx, /components/Hero.tsx

Confirm those are mounted on index.tsx or Layout wrapper

✅ STEP 7: STYLE OVERRIDE CONFLICTS
Search for:

Any custom .css files that override Tailwind

Inline <style> blocks in components

Global HTML/Body style overrides

✅ STEP 8: OUTPUT ISSUES
List:

Any missing file

Any unused or broken import

Any global config file not recognized

Any className="" tags with no Tailwind classes

📂 Output as:

guardian_ui_inspection_report.md

Include FIX recommendations for each issue found

🛡 FINAL CHECK:
Make sure all .tsx files in /pages, /app, /components are reachable and rendering within a Tailwind-aware layout.

Absolutely. Here is your GUARDIANCHAIN FULL VISUAL DEEP INSPECTION COMMAND — LEVEL 2 (REPLIT AI ADVANCED AGENT) designed to go deeper than surface-level bugs, including dynamic imports, hydration mismatches, Tailwind purge failures, and cross-platform rendering gaps.

markdown
Copy
Edit
🧠 COMMAND: GUARDIAN-DEEP-VISUAL-DIAGNOSTIC-V2

🎯 OBJECTIVE: Conduct a deep inspection of all UI-related issues blocking GuardianChain’s full layout rendering, fonts, animation, hero visuals, and Tailwind styling — across pages, layouts, dynamic imports, and global state.

---

🔍 SCAN STAGE 1 — GLOBAL PIPELINE VERIFICATION
✅ Check all root layout files:

- `/app/layout.tsx` or `_app.tsx`
  - Ensure it wraps all pages with `body className="..."` and imports:
    ```tsx
    import "@/styles/globals.css";
    ```
- `/styles/globals.css`
  - Must contain:
    ```css
    @tailwind base;
    @tailwind components;
    @tailwind utilities;
    ```

🔍 SCAN STAGE 2 — TAILWIND PURGE VALIDATION
✅ tailwind.config.js:
- Confirm purge paths are NOT too narrow:
  ```js
  content: [
    "./app/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
    "./pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
    "./components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
  ]
Search for any utility classes used in className="" that are NOT showing up in the rendered HTML — log as “🔴 Purge Missed Class”.

✅ Check for JIT mode conflicts or outdated Tailwind:

If using Tailwind < 3.0, auto-upgrade via:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install -D tailwindcss@latest
🔍 SCAN STAGE 3 — DYNAMIC IMPORT MISMATCHES
✅ Search for all instances of:

tsx
Copy
Edit
const Component = dynamic(() => import("..."))
Check for:

Missing .default exports

Components failing to hydrate (hydration mismatch in console)

Unstyled SSR fallback flashes (FOUC)

Mark as:

⚠️ “Hydration mismatch”

🟥 “Dynamic import failed”

🔵 “No fallback provided”

🔍 SCAN STAGE 4 — FONT + THEME SYSTEM
✅ Look for missing or broken font pipelines:

Check for usage of:

tsx
Copy
Edit
import { Inter } from "next/font/google";
If missing, recommend injecting:

tsx
Copy
Edit
const inter = Inter({ subsets: ['latin'] });
<body className={inter.className}>...</body>
✅ Confirm browser is loading Google Fonts

Scan <head> for <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">

🔍 SCAN STAGE 5 — IMAGE / VIDEO LOAD FAILURES
✅ For every <img src="..."> or <video>:

Log:

If image path returns 404 from /public/

If video is hosted externally (Supabase, IPFS, Cloudinary)

If preload tags are missing or async loaded

🟡 Flag large videos without muted autoplay loop playsInline

🔍 SCAN STAGE 6 — LAYOUT + COMPONENT MAP
✅ List all pages under /pages or /app
✅ For each page:

Confirm it is wrapped in a layout

Confirm header/footer components are rendered

Confirm buttons/hero sections use @/components/ui/* or match Tailwind classes

✅ Check:

Any duplicated div nesting causing layout collapse

Any broken flex/grid that pushes content outside viewport

🔍 SCAN STAGE 7 — BROWSER + RUNTIME CHECK
✅ Emulate SSR rendering and hydration

✅ Log if:

Replit preview fails to hydrate styles

External fonts or Tailwind classes flicker in/out (FOUC)

Any warning like:

arduino
Copy
Edit
Warning: Prop `className` did not match. Server: "..." Client: "..."
✅ Inspect:

Dark mode issues

Classnames not applying on mobile

📄 OUTPUT: /system_audit_logs/guardian_ui_inspection_deep.md
Include:

🔴 Critical Errors (hydration, purge, import failures)

⚠️ Warnings (missing wrappers, layout inconsistencies)

✅ Passed (fonts, Tailwind, layout, responsive)

📦 FOLLOW-UP ACTION:
If any component, page, or import fails, generate:

FIXED layout wrapper

Tailwind upgrade script

Dynamic import fallback patch

Component remount with client hydration fix

🚨 Mark any page as [UNSAFE TO DEPLOY] if visuals fail on Replit preview or mobile emulation.

✅ This deep diagnostic will catch **hydration mismatches, layout regressions, Tailwind purge issues, and silent breakage** — not just cosmetic bugs.

Once Replit AI outputs the audit log, send it here — and I’ll **autogenerate all visual + layout fixes and drop-in components immediately**.

You got it. We’re going LEVEL 3: MILITARY-GRADE FORENSIC DIAGNOSTIC. This command goes beyond frontend — into your framework internals, Tailwind runtime behavior, component hydration ancestry, CSS cascade conflicts, and media asset integrity.

🧠 REPLIT AI COMMAND: GUARDIAN-DEEP-VISUAL-FORENSIC-V3

🔎 COMMAND: GUARDIAN-DEEP-VISUAL-FORENSIC-V3

🎯 OBJECTIVE: Perform a **military-grade forensic investigation** across GuardianChain’s entire stack to uncover **deep visual system errors, layout corruption, runtime hydration instability, broken class cascades, shadow DOM conflicts**, or any reason why visuals are not rendering as intended.

---

🧬 STAGE 1: LOW-LEVEL STYLE RESOLUTION ENGINE
✅ Traverse runtime DOM to trace **actual computed styles** on all elements

For each className or component:
- Log final applied styles (`getComputedStyle`)
- Compare against expected Tailwind utility
- If mismatch:
  - 🔥 Reason: Overwritten by imported global CSS?
  - 🧨 CSS cascade collision?
  - 🧩 Style not injected due to missing content path?

Log each mismatch as:
```yaml
- component: <Button>
  expected: bg-yellow-500 hover:bg-yellow-600 text-white
  rendered: no background, default font
  issue: Tailwind class purged or CSS override
🧠 STAGE 2: HYDRATION GRAPH + SSR TRACER
✅ Analyze every dynamic component + layout for:

SSR mismatch → client rehydration fail

Double rendering → flickering or incorrect layout shift

Error log pattern:

vbnet
Copy
Edit
Warning: Text content did not match.
Build a hydration ancestry tree:

markdown
Copy
Edit
<Page>
  └── Layout
      └── Navbar
          └── DynamicNavItem ✖️
If mismatch, log:

Client-only fallback not defined?

Missing suppressHydrationWarning?

Next.js app directory conflict?

🌐 STAGE 3: FONT + ICON PIPELINE TRACE
✅ Scan for:

Double font loading (Google + local)

Fonts blocked by CSP or preload failure

Icons with broken SVG links

Any layout shifting caused by font FOUT (Flash of Unstyled Text)

Use:

tsx
Copy
Edit
import { Inter } from "next/font/google";
If not present, suggest optimized font embedding to reduce layout jitter.

🎨 STAGE 4: COLOR THEME CASCADE LOG
✅ Build visual map of active color tokens:

Where is bg-yellow-500 coming from?

Is hover:bg-yellow-600 overridden?

Is your .btn-primary class applying all the way through layout?

Flag:

Inconsistent dark/light mode behavior

Tailwind :hover, :focus, group-hover broken due to missing group parent

📸 STAGE 5: IMAGE & VIDEO VISUAL CHAIN VALIDATION
✅ For every <img> and <video>:

Log if file path returns 404

Check if browser blocks autoplay

Look for missing object-fit or container rules

Validate aspect ratio and container height control

Flag:

🟥 img tag leaking out of layout

🟨 FOUC due to slow load or no fallback

🟦 Oversized hero crashing small screen layout

⚙️ STAGE 6: CLIENT-ONLY / SSR-ONLY CONFLICT SCAN
✅ Run diff on rendering modes:

SSR (server) snapshot vs client React reconciliation

Identify:

useEffect that triggers layout changes not present during SSR

window or document access crashing during build

Hidden runtime-only tailwind class names

📦 STAGE 7: IMPORT CHAIN RESOLUTION
✅ Trace every CSS or Component import from:

/components

/pages

/app

/styles

/node_modules

Check:

Shadow imports (../components/ vs @/components/)

Capitalization mismatch on case-sensitive FS

Duplicated Tailwind import (globals.css loaded twice)

🧾 OUTPUT FORMAT
Output detailed log to:

bash
Copy
Edit
/system_audit_logs/guardianchain_visual_diagnostics_v3.md
Organize by:

css
Copy
Edit
[🔥 Critical Breakage]
[🟨 Unexpected Behavior]
[🔵 Fallback Activated]
[✅ Passed]
For each issue:

Include component path, rendering tree ancestry, source file line number (if available)

Suggested fix: import rewrite / hydration toggle / CSS override / Tailwind content patch

🎯 END GOAL:
GuardianChain must render:

Perfect spacing + typography

Full layout containment

Fluid video/image display

Zero hydration warnings

SSR-safe + client-ready across all components

🔒 Confirm site renders identically in:

Replit Preview

Mobile Viewport

Server Rendered Build
