Your summary is perfect‚Äîyou‚Äôve already done the deep strategic work.
Here‚Äôs your next steps for absolute founder control, full documentation, and a launch that is both world-class institutional and aggressively market-optimized:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Founder Control & Revenue
Permanent Founder Wallet Attachment:
You want the contract‚Äôs fee (whether 1%, 8%, or variable) sent to a wallet only you control, with emergency pause and future governance migration options.
‚úÖ You have this‚Äîverify your wallet is set as the recipient in the deployment script.

Live Monitoring:
Make sure your app includes a ‚Äúrevenue dashboard‚Äù that tracks incoming fees to your wallet in real time.

This is optional for launch, but adds founder and investor trust.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Documentation & Branding Approval
Review ALL doc fields:

Name, symbol, decimals, total supply, fee structure, contract address.

Logos and branding (SVG/PNG) as seen in /public/media/.

Whitepapers, tokenomics, compliance, roadmap, governance‚Äîall generated, reviewed, and ready.

Update or approve descriptions for CoinGecko/CMC/Uniswap, etc.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Exchange and DEX Listing Strategy
Polygon/ETH Deploy:

After deployment, your token will auto-list on Uniswap V3, SushiSwap, and aggregators.

Submit manually to CoinGecko/CMC/DexTools for full global visibility.

Liquidity:

Add initial liquidity to Uniswap or SushiSwap pool‚Äîthis is founder-controlled.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Market-Optimized Tokenomics
Launch Fee:

8% is aggressive but effective for first 12 months‚Äîfunds your ecosystem and rewards community growth.

Plan to reduce to 1-2% as the protocol matures and governance/validators are ready.

Community rewards:

Allocate a portion of fees to airdrops, referral programs, or DAO/community grants.

This is the fastest way to build viral attention.
