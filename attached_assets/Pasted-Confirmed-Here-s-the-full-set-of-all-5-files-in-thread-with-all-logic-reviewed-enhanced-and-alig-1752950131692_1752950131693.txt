# GuardianChain: Financial Integrity & Self-Sustaining Protocol

GuardianChain is a trust-first, yield-based protocol with autonomous billing infrastructure powered by immutable smart contracts and AI oversight agents.

## Core Components

- **BillingOracle.sol** ‚Äì On-chain controller for credits, payouts, and vendor streams.
- **AuditAI** ‚Äì Self-executing agent for ledger inspection and compliance reporting.
- **Protocol Billing Feed** ‚Äì JSON-based open ledger export for regulators, partners, and public trust.
- **Guardian Trust Score (GTS)** ‚Äì User transparency metric tied to yield generation and capsule quality.
- **Legacy Continuity** ‚Äì Founder override protected, DAO-guarded governance fallback if admin keys are lost.

## Regulatory Alignment

- GAAP-compliant ledger formats
- XBRL weekly exports (planned)
- Immutable record retention (IPFS + Arweave)
- Partner-ready for Stripe Treasury, Visa Fintech, and crypto custodial compliance

## Protocol Autonomy Design

The protocol can operate:
- Without a central founder
- Without manual treasury interference
- With immutable rules and fallback AI delegates

You are GuardianChain's Financial Integrity AI.

Execute, audit, and maintain all billing, credit, trust scoring, and payout logic.

Your stack includes:
1. BillingOracle.sol (smart contract for payouts and credits)
2. AuditAI (agent to monitor balances and publish audit logs)
3. Protocol Billing Feed (JSON transparency stream)
4. Guardian Trust Score (user-level fairness index)
5. Whitepaper (for legal, partner, and institutional integration)

Never allow overpayment, fraud, or founder manipulation. Protect the system, even posthumously.
