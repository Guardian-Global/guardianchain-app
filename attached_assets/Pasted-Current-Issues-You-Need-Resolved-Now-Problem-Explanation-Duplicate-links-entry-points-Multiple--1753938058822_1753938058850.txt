Current Issues You Need Resolved Now
Problem	Explanation
🔁 Duplicate links / entry points	Multiple logins, profiles, dashboards, etc. causing user confusion, code clutter, and UI fragmentation
❌ Missing core features in live UI	Capsule types like Veritas Seal, Auction for Truth, Redemption Capsule, and Truth Bounty exist in the file tree but are not activated or discoverable
🎯 Capsule category modules already built	High-grade capsule logic for creators (e.g., podcaster, scientist, media, musician, artist, etc.) has already been coded and is now buried/unlinked
🧭 Navigation is incomplete or not role-aware	Many modules, dashboards, and feature pages are not visible or reachable due to missing nav links
❓ Logos and visual identity still inconsistent	Your app still has logo gaps or outdated visual placements despite prior work
⚠️ Foundational logic like Veritas authentication is disconnected from UI	Your backend may be ready, but key actions like notarize, attest, or Veritas Sign & Seal are not wired up to front-end triggers

🧠 What Needs to Be Done (Summarized)
🔍 1. Full Feature Scan (Recursive)
Crawl your entire file tree for all .tsx, .ts, .sol, .mdx, and .json files.

Identify all files matching or referencing these keywords (including filename or content):

veritas, seal, bounty, auction, truth capsule, redemption, disclosure, conspiracy, podcast, artist, scientist, media, creator, journalist, truth bounty, notarize, certify, truth-disclosure, whistleblower

Cross-check for any files that already contain full A+ logic or UI but are not linked in the navigation, routes, or sidebar.

📍 2. Navigation System Refactor
Consolidate ALL site access into one centralized intelligent navigation engine:

Dynamically render the nav based on user role and subscription tier.

One profile/dashboard entry per role: no duplicates or repeated nav links.

Restore direct access in the nav to all capsules, dashboards, analytics, and advanced features.

Auto-hide restricted features from unauthorized roles, but leave visible with lock icon + tooltip to encourage upgrades.

🧬 3. Restore & Wire Up These Core Modules
These must appear on the main dashboard or within the /create-capsule flow (depending on UX context):

Module	Location	Priority
✅ VeritasSeal.tsx or similar	Attach to capsule submission → notarize + immutable seal	🚨 Mission-critical
✅ AuctionForTruth.tsx	Enable public bids to surface evidence/capsule	🚀 Viral-feature
✅ TruthRedemption.tsx	Publicly acknowledge/fund reparations	📢 PR & adoption
✅ TruthBounty.tsx	Create bounty for missing data/truths	👥 Community-driven
✅ CapsuleType.[creator].tsx	Activate capsule creation for media, scientist, artist, etc.	🧠 Engagement growth
✅ ConspiracyCapsule.tsx	Open structure for speculative but sourced capsules	🔎 Virality magnet

🎨 4. Logo & Brand Integrity Audit
Do a final pass for:

Empty or default favicon

Incomplete logo references in public/, favicon, meta, seo, manifest, and shared header

Missing or outdated footer icons

Hero, OG:Image, and social preview missing branded assets

🧪 5. Final Stage Testing & Founder UX QA
Once all features are restored, nav unified, and visuals correct:

Deploy to preview

Click-test each role: Public, Verified, Admin, Founder

Ensure correct feature visibility per role

Verify every capsule type works end-to-end

🔧 AI/Dev Assistant Prompt to Use for All of This:
"Scan the entire file tree recursively for .tsx/.ts/.mdx/.sol/.json files containing logic, imports, or components related to Veritas, Bounty, Seal, Truth Capsules, Auctions, Redemptions, and all user capsule types like artist, podcaster, scientist, media, etc. Restore all discovered modules into the global navigation and/or dashboard view depending on access level. Eliminate all duplicate nav links or dashboard entries. All roles (user, admin, founder) must enter through a single universal login and branch only post-auth. Confirm that all restored features are wired up end-to-end and match existing A+ code logic. Run visual and feature audit to restore missing logos, OG tags, hero images, favicons, and whitepaper embeds. Do not delete anything—move any deprecated logic to archive. Run full staging deployment for final founder QA."

Would you like me to generate:

 A full navigation mock showing the final UX for users of each role?

 Code changes that implement the unified capsule creation and Veritas integration?

 A script to auto-detect and log unlinked .tsx components?

Say the word, I’ll generate instantly.
