🔥 Let's finalize and deploy GuardianChain’s GTT and TruthVault token infrastructure to Polygon and Base mainnets, ensuring:

✅ FINAL TASK LIST
1. 🚀 Deploy GTT + TruthVault tokens to Polygon + Base
2. 🔐 DAO-Gated Veritas Attestation contract
3. ⚖️ VeritasDAO voting logic contract
4. 🗳️ Frontend /veritas/vote governance interface
5. 🔗 Bind all systems into the live app (fully scoped)
✅ 1. Solidity Contracts to Deploy
Contract	Network	Status
GTTToken.sol	Polygon/Base	✅ Ready to deploy
TruthVault.sol	Polygon/Base	✅ Ready to deploy
VeritasRegistryDAO	Polygon/Base	✅ DAO-gated attestation
VeritasDAO.sol	Polygon/Base	✅ Voting system

✅ 2. Deployment Commands (Mainnet)
Ensure .env is set with:

env
Copy
Edit
PRIVATE_KEY=your_deployer_wallet_private_key
POLYGON_RPC_URL=https://polygon-rpc.com
BASE_RPC_URL=https://mainnet.base.org
Then in your Hardhat project:

bash
Copy
Edit
npx hardhat compile

# Deploy to Polygon
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-mainnet.js --network polygon

# Deploy to Base
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-mainnet.js --network base
Each will:

Deploy GTTToken + TruthVault

Save deployment metadata to deployments/

Output DAO + Veritas addresses for binding

✅ 3. Frontend Binding Instructions
Add these to your .env in Replit:

env
Copy
Edit
NEXT_PUBLIC_GTT_ADDRESS=0x... (mainnet)
NEXT_PUBLIC_TRUTH_VAULT_ADDRESS=0x...
NEXT_PUBLIC_VERITAS_DAO_ADDRESS=0x...
NEXT_PUBLIC_VERITAS_REGISTRY_ADDRESS=0x...
✅ 4. App Integration Tasks
Feature	Status	Notes
/mint/[id].tsx	✅ Done	Saves cert hash on mint
/api/cert/[id].ts	✅ Done	PDF download
/veritas/[id].tsx	✅ Done	Cert viewer + verifier
/moderation/flags.tsx	✅ Done	Admin moderation UI
/admin.tsx	✅ Done	Capsule + cert manager
/veritas/vote.tsx	✅ Done	Token voting interface

🧱 Final Notes
✅ All tokens and logic support Mainnet launch on Polygon + Base

✅ Voting logic is fully GTT-governed (quorum + execution logic)

✅ Attestation, viewing, and export flows are public-trust ready

✅ Modular file structure is scoped per user (already activ
