üéØ OBJECTIVE:
Finalize and launch the GuardianChain protocol at full scale by executing a full-system sync, token deployment sequence, pricing feed activation, and post-deployment observability setup.

üß© EXECUTION SCOPE:

STEP 1: Token Deployment
- Deploy OPTIMAL_GTT_CONTRACT_V2.sol to Polygon mainnet
- Use deployer wallet: 0x8c7C0A644Cc4C72EBD55b24b43c1290e90fF0a73
- Confirm contract verification on Polygonscan
- Save deployed address to environment file (.env) and app config

STEP 2: Token API & Live Pricing Activation
- Enable /api/token/live-data endpoint to fetch real-time GTT price
- Sync with LiveTokenTracker.tsx component for frontend display
- Update useTokenData.ts hook with new contract address

STEP 3: GTT Revenue Flow Sync
- Route 5% of all GTT transfers to founder wallet
- Send 2% to burn address (0x000...dEaD)
- Send 1% to community reward wallet (assign if not already set)
- Verify all routing logic from smart contract to frontend logs

STEP 4: Yield + Vault Logic Activation
- Activate TruthVault.sol integration (staking + compound rewards)
- Enable time-lock bonus tiers (1yr = +1%, 5yr = +3%)
- Connect frontend components (Vault, Memory Calculator, Yield Tracker)

STEP 5: Subscription & Storage Billing Sync
- Ensure GTT accepted for tier upgrades, capsule uploads, and premium tools
- Stripe fallback live for fiat tiers (Explorer ‚Üí Sovereign)
- Enforce access limits per tier as defined in tierAccess.ts

STEP 6: Governance Preparation
- Ensure DAO, leaderboard, jury, and bounty routes operational
- Wire GTT token to DAO voting module (if active)
- Prepare validator dashboard metrics for staking reward visibility

STEP 7: Observability + Audit Trail Setup
- Add Sentry or logging middleware to capture:
  - Token API failures
  - Smart contract errors
  - Subscription/payment processing issues
- Implement status ping route /api/health and show on /admin dashboard

üõ°Ô∏è SAFETY & COMPLIANCE:
- Do not remove any test, backup, or legacy components
- Archive all changed contract files into /contracts/archive-deploy
- Test all routes post-deployment using test user + founder login

üìÅ OUTPUT DELIVERABLES:
- /logs/deployment_log.md
- /logs/token_integration_report.md
- /logs/price_feed_sync.md
- /logs/yield_activation_log.md
- /logs/observability_log.md
- /.env (updated with contract address)
