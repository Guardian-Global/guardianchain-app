üöÄ **Founder Request: Unified Auth & Tiered Access Audit** üöÄ

As the founder and creator of **GuardianChain**, I need you to:

1. **Discover & Catalog**  
   ‚Ä¢ List every file and folder involved in authentication, onboarding, login, user profile, dashboard, tiered-access, enterpriseAuth, masterAdmin, and footer/navigation links.  

2. **Eliminate Public Exposure**  
   ‚Ä¢ Identify all routes, nav items or footer links that expose `enterpriseAuth` or `masterAdmin` to unauthenticated or free users.  
   ‚Ä¢ Remove or hide these so there is **only one** public entry point: `/login`.  

3. **Single Entry Point**  
   ‚Ä¢ Refactor the app so **all** users‚Äîfree, paid tiers, enterprise, and master admins‚Äîmust pass through the same `/login` route.  
   ‚Ä¢ After login, redirect based on role/subscription status:
     - **Free** ‚Üí `/dashboard/free`
     - **Paid Tier X** ‚Üí `/dashboard/tierX`
     - **Enterprise** ‚Üí `/dashboard/enterprise`
     - **Master Admin** ‚Üí `/dashboard/admin`

4. **Role-Based Nav & Features**  
   ‚Ä¢ Implement or tighten middleware/HOC on every protected route so that only users with the proper role/subscription see the matching nav items and pages.  
   ‚Ä¢ Verify that free users **cannot** see or access paid features.  
   ‚Ä¢ Sync feature visibility dynamically against the user‚Äôs subscription record (e.g., Stripe customer metadata).

5. **Subscription & Billing Integration**  
   ‚Ä¢ Audit or add hooks to your signup flow to collect subscription fees via Stripe (or your chosen provider).  
   ‚Ä¢ Ensure subscription status is stored in your user database and used by your front‚Äêend to gate feature flags.

6. **Remove Duplication & Sync Auth Logic**  
   ‚Ä¢ Delete any duplicate or conflicting auth code‚Äîe.g. multiple login forms, multiple middleware implementations.  
   ‚Ä¢ Consolidate all auth/session logic into a single module (e.g. `auth.js` or a Next.js middleware).

7. **Deliverables**  
   ‚Ä¢ A detailed list of file renames/deletions.  
   ‚Ä¢ Exact code diffs for each modified file (React components, API routes, middleware).  
   ‚Ä¢ Configuration changes (next.config.js, replit.nix, .replit, environment variables).  
   ‚Ä¢ A summary of tests or manual steps to verify that:
     - There is only one `/login`.  
     - Unauthorized access is blocked.  
     - Tiered features are correctly hidden/shown.  
     - Subscription fees are collected on signup.

Please produce a **complete audit report** and **patch-ready diffs** so I can apply these changes immediately.
