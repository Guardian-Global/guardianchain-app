ðŸ§  SYSTEM COMMAND: GUARDIAN-TOKEN-DEPLOYMENT-AUDIT

Please build a full deployment report covering all deployed tokens and integrated token-related logic.

âœ… PART 1: Token Deployment Detection
- Scan all `.sol`, `deploy-*.js`, `.ts`, and `.env` files for deployed token configurations.
- Identify token names, symbols, addresses, and networks.
- Report if any token has been deployed twice (duplicate GTT).

âœ… PART 2: Live Token Pricing & Metrics
- Fetch live token balances and prices via CoinGecko or blockchain explorer APIs.
- Show current:
  - Token price in USD
  - Circulating supply
  - Market cap (estimate)
  - Daily volume (if available)
- If two GTT variants exist, compare both.

âœ… PART 3: Revenue Generation Logic (App-Side)
- Identify all app features tied to token revenue:
  - Capsule fees
  - Yield rewards
  - Premium subscriptions (tier system)
  - Auction fees or unlock payments
- Show where token fees flow (wallet, burn address, contract).
- Validate if tokenomics match 5% founder / 2% burn / 1% community.

âœ… PART 4: GTT Routing & Financial Flow
- Map all token interactions:
  - Mint
  - Buy/sell
  - Withdraw
  - Admin fee routes
  - Community rewards
- Include wallet addresses and logic for each routing type.

âœ… PART 5: Yield & Distribution Logic
- Trace smart contract functions tied to yield payout.
- Validate:
  - Time-lock logic
  - Vault or staking triggers
  - Capsule replay or unlock logic
  - Reward tiers (authors, witnesses, holders)
- Show % distribution to each role.

âœ… PART 6: Deployment Logs & Confirmation
- Check for duplicate deploys or misconfigured contracts.
- Generate:
  - `token_deployment_summary.md`
  - `token_pricing_report.md`
  - `token_yield_routing_log.md`
  - `revenue_logic_summary.md`

âœ… BONUS (Optional):
- Detect Uniswap/QuickSwap liquidity pool presence
- Track recent trades, volume, and holder count (if RPC enabled)

DO NOT DELETE anything â€” only generate logs and extract pricing, logic, and routing.
