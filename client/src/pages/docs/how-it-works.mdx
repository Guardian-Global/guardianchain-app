# How GuardianChain Works

## Overview

GuardianChain is a revolutionary Web3 platform that combines blockchain technology, artificial intelligence, and community governance to create an immutable truth preservation ecosystem. Our platform enables users to create, verify, and preserve digital memories and testimonies for future generations.

## Core Components

### 1. Truth Capsules

Truth Capsules are the fundamental units of our platform - immutable containers for digital memories, testimonies, and experiences.

**Features:**
- **Immutable Storage**: Content is cryptographically sealed and stored on blockchain
- **AI Verification**: Advanced ML models analyze content for authenticity
- **Time-lock Mechanisms**: Set future dates for automatic capsule revelation
- **Grief Scoring**: Community-driven emotional resonance measurement
- **NFT Integration**: Each capsule can be minted as a unique digital asset

**Types of Capsules:**
- Personal Memories
- Family Legacy Documents
- Professional Testimonies
- Historical Records
- Creative Works
- Whistleblower Submissions
- Time-locked Messages

### 2. Blockchain Infrastructure

Our platform leverages Ethereum and Polygon networks for security and scalability.

**Technical Stack:**
- **Smart Contracts**: ERC-721 NFTs for capsule ownership
- **IPFS Storage**: Decentralized content distribution
- **Cryptographic Hashing**: SHA-256 for content integrity
- **Digital Signatures**: Wallet-based authentication
- **Merkle Proofs**: Efficient verification without revealing content

### 3. GTT Token Economy

The GuardianChain Token (GTT) powers our ecosystem's economic incentives.

**Token Utilities:**
- **Yield Generation**: Earn rewards based on grief score and community engagement
- **Governance Rights**: Vote on platform upgrades and policy changes
- **Premium Features**: Access advanced verification and storage options
- **Staking Rewards**: Lock tokens for enhanced yields and platform benefits
- **Transaction Fees**: Pay for minting, verification, and premium services

**Tokenomics:**
- Total Supply: 1 Billion GTT
- Distribution: 40% Community, 25% Team, 20% Ecosystem, 15% Investors
- Inflation Rate: Deflationary model with token burns
- Staking APY: 8-15% based on grief score multiplier

### 4. AI-Powered Verification

Our verification system uses cutting-edge AI to ensure content authenticity.

**Verification Levels:**
