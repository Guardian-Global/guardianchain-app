- [x] Multichain bridge support ready
- [ ] Awaiting mainnet deployment for cross-chain setup

### üìã FINAL DEPLOYMENT STEPS

#### Step 1: Fund Deployer Wallet
```bash
# Send 0.1+ MATIC to: 0x959C1E8Baa6EB72A0A9F2547B59176a96dD239db
# Mumbai testnet faucet: https://faucet.polygon.technology/
```

#### Step 2: Deploy Contracts
```bash
npm run deploy:mumbai
# Expected output: Contract addresses for GTT and TruthVault
```

#### Step 3: Update Frontend Constants
```typescript
// Update shared/constants.ts with deployed addresses
CONTRACT_ADDRESSES.MUMBAI.GTTToken = "0x..."
CONTRACT_ADDRESSES.MUMBAI.TruthVault = "0x..."
```

#### Step 4: Configure Liquidity Pools
- Initialize Uniswap V3 GTT/MATIC pool
- Set initial liquidity parameters
- Configure yield distribution

#### Step 5: Launch Verification
- [x] Test all user flows
- [x] Verify mobile responsiveness  
- [x] Confirm admin controls
- [x] Validate API endpoints
