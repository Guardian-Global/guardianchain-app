### Common Issues
1. **404 Error**: Ensure "main" branch and "/public" folder are selected
2. **CSS Not Loading**: Check file paths in index.html
3. **PDF Not Accessible**: Verify file is in public/ directory
4. **Custom Domain Issues**: Check DNS configuration

### Force Refresh Deployment
```bash
# Make a small change and push to trigger redeployment
git commit --allow-empty -m "Trigger GitHub Pages rebuild"

## Integration with Main Platform
The static site serves as an investor-ready landing page while the main platform runs on:
- **Development**: Replit environment
- **Production**: Deployable via suggested infrastructure

This dual approach provides maximum investor accessibility while maintaining the full Web3 platform functionality.
