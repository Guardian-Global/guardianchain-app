# 🔑 PRIVATE KEY REQUIRED FOR DEPLOYMENT

## Current Status ✅
- **✅ QuickNode RPC URL:** Configured and working
- **✅ Smart Contracts:** Compiled successfully
- **✅ Deployment Script:** Ready to execute

## ⚠️ MISSING: Your Wallet Private Key

To complete the deployment, I need your deployer wallet private key.

### How to get your private key from MetaMask:
1. Open MetaMask
2. Click the 3 dots menu on your account
3. Select "Account Details"
4. Click "Show Private Key"
5. Enter your MetaMask password
6. Copy the private key (starts with 0x)

### Add to configuration:
```bash
PRIVATE_KEY=0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef
```

**SECURITY NOTE:** 
- Only share this in our secure chat
- This key controls your $30.50 deployment wallet
- Never share this anywhere else

**Once you provide the private key, deployment executes in 5-10 minutes!**

## Post-Deployment Automatic Actions:
1. ✅ Deploy all 6 smart contracts
2. ✅ Verify contracts on Etherscan
3. ✅ Update frontend configuration
4. ✅ Your app goes live immediately
5. ✅ Ready for DEX listing and trading

**Paste your private key and I'll complete the mainnet launch!**
